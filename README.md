# Data Analytics Portfolio
### Isabelle Petersen

Hi! I’m Izzy, a data analyst and Math & Computer Science grad based in New York with a strong interest in turning data into clear, actionable insights.

I created this portfolio to highlight selected projects, both from my time at school and done on my own time, that focused on predictive modeling, business insights, and visual storytelling. My work always emphasizes a strong level of analytical rigor but also creativity; I like to think out of the box to represent and solve problems  I have experience using data to inform decisions in education, product, and customer-focused contexts.
