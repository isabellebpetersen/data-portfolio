# Ad Performance Metrics (Mock Data)

This project demonstrates how I would analyze ad campaign performance using mock data.

## Goal

Evaluate the performance of multiple ad creatives and channels by looking at:

- Impressions
- Clicks
- Installs or sign-ups
- Spend
- Derived metrics (CTR, CPC, CPA, conversion rate)

## Example Questions

1. Which creative has the best click-through rate (CTR)?
2. Which channel has the lowest cost per acquisition (CPA)?
3. How would I recommend reallocating budget based on performance?

## Tools

- Python or R
- Pandas / dplyr
- Basic plotting libraries (matplotlib/ggplot2)
