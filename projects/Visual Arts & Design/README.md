# Visual Art and Graphic Design

In my free time, I do a lot with graphic design. I love being able to creatively organize and expres my ideas on paper, and I especially love helping other people's visions come to life.

At Fordham, I spent some time on the *Fordham Observer* (Fordham Lincoln Center's newspaper) as a graphics contributor. I mainly used Canva for my designs, as well as Adobe Illustrator and Photoshop.
Examples of my work on the Observer can be found [here](Observer). 

I also enjoy making hand-painted banners for birthday parties, allowing me to experiment with a variety of different aesthetics. Every banner I create is an original design I created, sometimes in collaboration with the person who's hosting the party to make sure I nailed the aesthetic they were picturing.
Examples of some banners I've made (and mockups for some upcoming ones) can be found [here](Journal).

On a more personal note, I also keep a bullet journal (and have since I was in high school) that I use like a planner, tracker, and place to dump my thoughts, lists, and anything else I need to keep organized. For me this is a place for me to experiment with design in a low-stakes environment (since it's just for me) but I'm incredibly proud of how I've used it over the years to keep myself organized and find a unique style that works for me. 
Some of my favorite spreads can be found [here](Banners).

I included this section in my portfolio because when I work with data, it really matters to me that I present things in a clear and concise way that is easily understood and accessible across all different backgrounds. So, sometimes this means getting creative with the way I create visuals and choose to organize my findings. When it comes to findings with data, the way you present it matters, and this work shows that I will always take the time and effort to think about visual aesthetics.
