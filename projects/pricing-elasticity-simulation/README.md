# Pricing Elasticity Simulation

This project explores how changes in price affect demand and revenue using a simulated dataset.

## Goal

Model a simple relationship between price and quantity demanded, and use it to:

- Visualize how demand changes with price
- Estimate an "optimal" price range for revenue
- Practice thinking like a product or pricing analyst

## Tools

- R
- `tidyverse` (or base R)
- Basic plotting functions (`ggplot2` if available)

## Questions I Consider

1. How does demand change as price increases?
2. At what price range is revenue maximized in this simulated scenario?
3. How sensitive are conclusions to assumptions about user behavior?

## Files

- `pricing_elasticity_analysis.R` — generates the simulated data, runs analysis, and creates plots.
