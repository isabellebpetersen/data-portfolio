# Pricing Elasticity Simulation

This project explores how changes in price affect demand and revenue using simulated data.

## Goal

The goal of this project is to understand the relationship between pricing and consumer behavior, and to demonstrate how data modeling can inform pricing decisions in a product or business context.

## What’s included
