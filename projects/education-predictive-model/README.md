# Education Prediction Model (Simulated Learner Data)

This project is inspired by my internship at Modern States and my senior thesis. It uses simulated data to protect privacy.

## Goal

Predict exam success based on engagement features such as:

- Number of lessons completed
- Practice questions attempted
- Time spent
- Location or region
- Previous experience

## Approach

- Generate a synthetic dataset in R
- Fit a logistic regression or tree-based model
- Evaluate model performance
- Interpret key features
- Propose targeted interventions based on the results

## Tools

- R
- `tidyverse`
- `glm` or a simple modeling package
