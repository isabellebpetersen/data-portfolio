# Education Prediction Model (Simulated Learner Data)

This project was the culmination of all of my math and computer science studies at Fordham, in a field I was passionate about. With a rigorous statistical lens, I looked at attributes of students taking CLEP exams and analyzed whether or not these attributes were correlated with success on the exam, looking for trends that can be used to understand the gaps in accessibility to higher education. I also propose targeted interventions based on my findings to work toward closing these gaps.

## Goal

Predict exam success based on engagement features such as:

- Whether or not a learner is taking an exam for the first time
- How much time a student spent engaging with course materials before taking the exam
- Average quiz score on course content leading up to the exam

## Approach

- Use regression in R to test the hypothesis that these factors have a linear relationship with exam performance
- Use two-sample t-tests to test the hypothesis that these factors on average contribute to higher/lower scores
- Use ggplot2 package in R to create sophisticated visuals contextualizing the demographics of my data

## Tools

- R (t-tests and advanced visuals)
- Excel (Learner Demographics visuals)
